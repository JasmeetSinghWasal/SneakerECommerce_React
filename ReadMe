Hello ,

Steps to run the project on your local : 

    1. Clone the repo 
    2. From the root run "cd client" and "npm i"
    3. From the root run "cd server" and npm i
    4. Run npm start in both client and server folders.

Make sure your server runs on port 3001

Before starting your work make sure to take latest from branch
    git pull


After you changes are done, make sure to delete the node_modules folder from client and server folders and then push
    git push
